# üìñ Book Notes ‚úçÔ∏è

I've read many books from which, after a while, I can't recall many ideas.

**_Can you believe it?_**

Well, it's possible that you have experienced the same feeling and you are not happy with it. Neither am I. That's why I've decided to devote some time to gathering some notes to remember better the learnings of my (_mainly_) tech readings.

Inspired by others like [Be√±at Espi√±a](https://github.com/benatespina/) and [his own book-notes](https://github.com/benatespina/book-notes), I'm going to try to make this useful for me. If it is also helpful for you, I encourage you to do the same.

**_Do not forget to purchase these pieces of knowledge!_** ;)

For my personal learning interest. More information about other tech & non-fiction books that I've read (no notes) can be found on [my page at Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14559292-javier-estraviz).
